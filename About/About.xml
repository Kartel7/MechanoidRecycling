You don't know what to do with dead mechanoids? Recycle them! Detach their bionic arms and legs or completely disassemble them to electric and hull parts.

You can disassemble mechanoids into their component parts and craft bionics using them.

Features:
[done] Detach bionic arms, legs, hands, feet, ears and eyes from immobilized mechanoids
[done] Disassemble mechanoid corpses into its parts
[done] Melt mechanoid parts into metals
[done] Craft bionic prostheses from mechanoid parts (need 'mechanoid bionics' research)
[wip] Mechanoid weapons will be drops and can be sold or recycle into metals and something like plasma crystal fragments
[wip] Plasma crystal fragments will be combined into full crystal for using it into turrets and maybe hand weapons
[planned] Unconnecting prostheses from human and mechanoid corpses
[planned] Installing human brain into reconstructed mechanoid (as soon as I learn how to do it)
[idea] Using artifical mechanoid brain for build improved multi-analyzer
